# senior-project

## Action Items

- By Next Meeting:
  - Introduction/Background Literature Review (why is the problem interesting, what has been done, 10-15 pages, mendeley for references - desktop & web plugin maybe can integrate with RStudio, can include statistics on food safety violations in Chicago maybe if it's worse than other cities)
  - Think about model: fit a simple one, do we want to do binary, do this before adding other data
  - Simple data visualizations
 
- Next Steps:
  -   Playing around with test and train data (balancing, removing COVID years?, etc.)
  -   Trying machine learning (e.g. random forest) instead of just logistic regression
  -   See which combinations of variables work better
